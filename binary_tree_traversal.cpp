    // Traversal in binary tree are basically of three types:
    //  1.> PreOrdre Traversal :- In preorder traversal , firstly root node is considered then left side and in last the right side of the tree is traversed. As root appears here at first, it is called preorder traversal.
    //  2.> PostOrder Traversal :- In postorder traversal , firstly left node is considered then comes the turn of right node and in last the root node is traversed . As root appears at last, it is called postorder traversal.
    //  3.> InOrder Traversal :- In inorder traversal, firstly left node is traversed then the root node in middle and in last the right node is taken in consideration. As root appears at middle here , it is called inorder traversal.
